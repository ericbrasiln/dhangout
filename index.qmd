## HEMDIG(pt) {.center}

#### A Framework for Collecting, Organizing, and Processing Digitized Newspaper Pages in Portuguese 

::: {.notes}
First, I would like to thank Joana and Daniel for inviting me to participate in this event. It is a pleasure to be here and to present this research developed last year at the DH Lab of Universidade NOVA de Lisboa. HemDig(pt) is a framework I developed to handle digitized newspapers, and the idea here is to provide a summary of what was done, the challenges faced, and the results obtained.

## Motivation {.center}

- Historical Newspapers
- Challenges
- Current Gap
- Objective

::: {.notes}
- **Historical Newspapers:** In recent years, I have observed the growing use of these sources in research in Brazil, especially with the popularization of the Brazilian Digital Newspaper Library, an initiative by the National Library of Brazil. Many journal articles, theses, and dissertations have utilized these sources to investigate various aspects of Brazilian history.
But at the same time, there is a methodological silence about their use: how the research is conducted, what methods are used for processing these digital objects, and moreover, how such issues epistemologically impact the research carried out. I have been researching and publishing on these issues, and HemDig(pt) is an attempt to systematize some of these reflections and collaborate with researchers who deal with digitized newspapers.
- **Challenges:** Large volumes, diverse formats, and varying quality. Challenges are also related to the graphical interfaces for accessing digitized newspapers and the research possibilities these collections offer.
- **Current Gap:** Few debates in Portuguese, few models trained for OCR in Portuguese. Do repositories in other languages face the same issues?
- **Objective:** Develop a comprehensive framework for efficient data collection and processing of digitized newspapers in Portuguese.

## Phase 1: Planning and Preparation {.center}

![Phase 1 Diagram](https://ericbrasiln.github.io/hemdig-framework/_images/1fase_mermaid-diagram-2023-08-21-171600.png)

::: {.notes}
The first phase consists of methodological and technical planning and preparation. This phase introduces a set of tools and strategies to develop basic knowledge and resources, ensuring subsequent phases are executed more efficiently and accurately.
:::

---

## Phase 1: Planning and Preparation {.center}

1. [Literature Review](https://ericbrasiln.github.io/hemdig-framework/part1/capitulo1/cap1.html)
2. [Basic Technical Preparation](https://ericbrasiln.github.io/hemdig-framework/part1/capitulo2/cap2.html)
3. [Research Planning](https://ericbrasiln.github.io/hemdig-framework/part1/capitulo3/cap3.html)

::: {.notes}
- **Literature Review:** In this stage, I present Zotero as a tool for managing bibliographic references; and the conduction of a bibliographic survey on topics related to digitized newspapers in the Scopus and Web of Science databases. As a result, a collection called HEMDIG(pt) was created and added to the public reference library Digital History.

- **Basic Technical Preparation:** In this chapter, we aim to present some tutorials from Programming Historian organized into the following topics: Basic Computational Knowledge, Data Management, and Writing and Publishing.

We do not seek to conduct an exhaustive survey of themes or fill gaps in training, but rather to point out directions and define a minimum level of technical knowledge to begin the research.

- **Research Planning:** In addition to the bibliographic survey and minimum technical training, as indicated in chapters 1 and 2, it is important to define, even if generally and preliminarily, the specific planning aimed at documentation, organization, preservation, and licensing of the research.

In other words, it is essential to develop a Data Management Plan (DMP), which should be created in this first phase and updated throughout its development.

Here, we discuss the FAIR principles, version control systems, tools like Zotero, Tropy, and data licensing.

## Phase 2: Critique of Collections {.center}

![Phase 2 Diagram](https://ericbrasiln.github.io/hemdig-framework/_images/2fase_mermaid-diagram-2023-08-21-172523.png)

::: {.notes}
The second phase involves the critical evaluation of the collections and graphical interfaces of the selected repositories. This task is crucial for understanding the biases, limitations, and possibilities of each collection, and for developing consistent methodological strategies and theoretical reflections aligned with the technical, political, and theoretical aspects of each repository.
:::

---

## Phase 2: Critique of Collections {.center}

1. [Evaluation of Repositories](https://ericbrasiln.github.io/hemdig-framework/part2/capitulo4/cap4.html): Brazilian Digital Newspaper Library, Newspaper collection of the National Digital Library of Portugal, and Municipal Newspaper Library of Lisbon.
2. [Analysis of Graphical Interfaces](https://ericbrasiln.github.io/hemdig-framework/part2/capitulo5/cap5.html)
3. [Comparative Effort](https://ericbrasiln.github.io/hemdig-framework/part2/capitulo6/cap6.html)

::: {.notes}
- **Case Studies:** Evaluation of three repositories: Brazilian Digital Newspaper Library, National Digital Library of Portugal, and Municipal Newspaper Library of Lisbon. Detailed analysis in Chapter 4.

I sought to present the general data of each collection and provide visualizations of this data so that future research can be developed. The general characterization of the digitized collections from these institutions is not currently available in their own search interfaces, which directly affects the research and use of these collections. Therefore, the organized and graphical presentation of this data, as done in this chapter, is a contribution to the research and use of these collections.

- **Analysis of Graphical Interfaces:** Evaluation of the graphical interfaces of the selected repositories using the Impresso project's method. Detailed in Chapter 5.

I conducted a critical evaluation of various aspects of the graphical interfaces of each collection, using the methodology proposed by Ehrmann, Bunout, and Düring [Ehrmann et al., 2019].

In their research, the authors developed a comprehensive and detailed questionnaire covering six evaluation criteria subdivided into about 140 items. In the original study, this questionnaire was applied to twenty-four graphical interfaces of historical newspaper collections.

The article presents interesting results about the different stages of each interface, as well as common characteristics and general limitations. However, the research was focused on repositories in Western Europe and the United States, and did not include any collections in Portuguese or Spanish.

Given this limitation, I sought to apply the method to the graphical interfaces of historical newspaper collections in Portuguese.

I translated and adapted the questionnaire, applied it to the graphical interfaces of the selected collections, and found significant similarities in the results obtained.

These results are presented in the next chapter.

- **Comparative Effort:** Provides elements for comparing collections and interfaces, including data and visualizations. Detailed in Chapter 6.

## Collection Characteristics {.center}

- Geographical Bias: Centralization in Rio de Janeiro and Lisbon in the HDB and BND-PT, respectively.
- Temporal Bias: HDB and BND-PT collections are concentrated in the last decades of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century.
- Language: Collections are almost entirely composed of newspapers in Portuguese.

## Interface Characteristics {.center}

- Sources criticism: Presence of important registered and accessible metadata.
- Content Search and Filtering: Reasonable capability for content search and result filtering.
- Generosity and Connectivity: Very low possibility of discovering new content beyond list results, integrating research with other repositories.
- User content management: Lack of functionalities for organizing, tagging, comparing, and sharing results.

## Phase 3: Data Collection {.center}

![Phase 3 Diagram](https://ericbrasiln.github.io/hemdig-framework/_images/3fase_mermaid-diagram-2023-08-21-173800.png)

::: {.notes}
In this phase, we outline strategies for the collection and organization of data and metadata from the studied collections.
:::

## Phase 3: Data Collection {.center}

1. [Reports and Documentation of Searches](https://ericbrasiln.github.io/hemdig-framework/part3/capitulo7/sec71.html)
2. [Data Scraper](https://ericbrasiln.github.io/hemdig-framework/part3/capitulo8/cap8.html)
3. [Organization of Datasets](https://ericbrasiln.github.io/hemdig-framework/part3/capitulo9/cap9.html)

::: {.notes}
- **Reports and Documentation of Searches:** Importance of consistent documentation and methodological registration.

To this end, I created small Python scripts to generate search reports, which function as methodological support tools. These scripts record data about the repositories, the searches conducted, the criteria used, and the results obtained. These reports are generated automatically and can be used to document and record the search process, facilitating the replication and review of the research.

- **Data Scrapers:** Tools and strategies for metadata and data collection.

When there are no open data policies or APIs to access data, it is necessary to develop data scraping strategies.

To collect data from the HDB, it is recommended to use pyHDB, a tool written in Python that allows you to search and download data from the HDB. The tool collects metadata from searches and downloads images of pages with occurrences of the searched terms (when permitted by copyright).

I also created a scraper for the Digital Library of Portugal and the Digital Newspaper Library of Lisbon: Collect data and metadata using Selenium and Beautiful Soup.

- **Organization of Datasets:** Strategies for organizing collected data.

## Phase 4: Data Processing {.center}

1. [Definition of Strategies: Volume and Quality of Data](https://ericbrasiln.github.io/hemdig-framework/part4/capitulo10/cap10.html)
2. [CLI Tools: Tesseract, OCR-D, Kraken](https://ericbrasiln.github.io/hemdig-framework/part4/capitulo12/cap12.html)
3. [GUI Tools: gImageReader](https://ericbrasiln.github.io/hemdig-framework/part4/capitulo13/cap13.html)
4. [Programming Historian Lessons](https://ericbrasiln.github.io/hemdig-framework/part4/capitulo11/cap11.html)

::: {.notes}
We conducted a series of tests with different tools, ranging from CLI (Command Line Interface) to GUI (Graphical User Interface), and with varying levels of complexity. We also listed a series of lessons from Programming Historian that are useful for those seeking to perform OCR on newspapers.

This chapter is divided as follows:

- CLI Tools: Command Line Interface tools, namely Tesseract, OCR-D, and Kraken.
- GUI Tools: Graphical User Interface tools, namely gImageReader.
- Programming Historian Lessons

For each of these topics, we present a set of tutorials, documentation, tests, and results obtained.

Our goal, more than providing a step-by-step guide for using each tool, is to present the main features, advantages, and disadvantages, and promote critical reflection on their use.

Like the entire framework, we aim to provide researchers with knowledge and materials to consciously and critically develop their workflows.
