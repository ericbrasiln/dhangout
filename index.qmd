![Diagram of HemDig(pt) Framework Phases](https://github.com/ericbrasiln/hemdig-framework/blob/main/book/assets/images/full-diagram.png?raw=true)

---

## Phase 1: Planning and Preparation {.center}

![Phase 1 Diagram](https://ericbrasiln.github.io/hemdig-framework/_images/1fase_mermaid-diagram-2023-08-21-171600.png)

::: {.notes}
The first phase consists of methodological and technical planning and preparation. This phase introduces a set of tools and strategies to develop basic knowledge and resources, ensuring subsequent phases are executed more efficiently and accurately.
:::

---

## Phase 1: Planning and Preparation {.center}

1. Literature Review
2. Basic Technical Preparation
3. Research Planning

::: {.notes}
- **Literature Review:** Initial review of relevant literature and tools (Zotero, Scopus).
- **Basic Technical Preparation:** Introduction to key lessons from Programming Historian. Basic computational skills, data management, writing, and publishing.
- **Research Planning:** Strategies for documentation, data organization, and licensing.
:::

## Phase 2: Critique of Collections {.center}

![Phase 2 Diagram](https://ericbrasiln.github.io/hemdig-framework/_images/2fase_mermaid-diagram-2023-08-21-172523.png)

::: {.notes}
The second phase involves the critical evaluation of the collections and graphical interfaces of the selected repositories. This task is crucial for understanding the biases, limitations, and possibilities of each collection, and for developing consistent methodological strategies and theoretical reflections aligned with the technical, political, and theoretical aspects of each repository.
:::

---

## Phase 2: Critique of Collections {.center}

1. Case Studies: Brazilian Digital Newspaper Library, National Digital Library of Portugal, and Municipal Newspaper Library of Lisbon.
2. Analysis of Graphical Interfaces
3. Comparative Effort

::: {.notes}
- **Case Studies:** Evaluation of three repositories: Brazilian Digital Newspaper Library, National Digital Library of Portugal, and Municipal Newspaper Library of Lisbon. Detailed analysis in Chapter 4.
- **Analysis of Graphical Interfaces:** Evaluation of the graphical interfaces of the selected repositories using the Impresso project's method. Detailed in Chapter 5.
- **Comparative Effort:** Provides elements for comparing collections and interfaces, including data and visualizations. Detailed in Chapter 6.

## Phase 3: Data Collection {.center}

![Phase 3 Diagram](https://ericbrasiln.github.io/hemdig-framework/_images/3fase_mermaid-diagram-2023-08-21-173800.png)

::: {.notes}
In this phase, we outline strategies for the collection and organization of data and metadata from the studied collections.
:::

---

## Phase 3: Data Collection {.center}

1. Reports and Documentation of Searches
2. Data Scraper
3. Organization of Datasets

::: {.notes}
- **Reports and Documentation of Searches:** Importance of consistent documentation and methodological registration.
- **Data Scrapers:** Tools and strategies for metadata and data collection.
- **Organization of Datasets:** Strategies for organizing collected data.
:::

## Phase 4: Data Processing {.center}

![Phase 4 Diagram](https://ericbrasiln.github.io/hemdig-framework/_images/4fase_mermaid-diagram-2023-08-21-225902.png)

::: {.notes}
This phase organizes tutorials, documentation, and tools for executing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and OLR (Optical Layout Recognition) on digitized Portuguese-language newspapers.
:::

---

## Phase 4: Data Processing {.center}

1. Testing and Evaluation
2. CLI Tools: Tesseract, OCR-D, Kraken
3. GUI Tools: gImageReader
4. Programming Historian Lessons

::: {.notes}
- **Testing and Evaluation:** Comprehensive evaluation of OCR tools. Free and open-source  CLI and GUI tools were tested and evaluated.
- **CLI Tools:** Tutorials, documentation, tests, and results for Tesseract, OCR-D, and Kraken.
- **GUI Tools:** Tutorials, documentation, tests, and results for gImageReader.
- **Programming Historian Lessons:** Relevant lessons for those interested in OCR.
## More than providing step-by-step usage guides, the goal is to present key features, advantages, and disadvantages of each tool.
## Encourage critical reflection on the use of these tools.
## Support researchers with knowledge and materials to consciously and critically develop their workflows.

## Phase 5: Review, Preservation, and Publication {.center}

![Phase 5 Diagram](https://ericbrasiln.github.io/hemdig-framework/_images/5fase_mermaid-diagram-2023-08-21-225829.png)

::: {.notes}
In this final phase of the framework, the objective is to conduct a comprehensive review of the documentation, metadata, and data structure, as well as to publish the research data.
:::

---

## Phase 5: Review, Preservation, and Publication {.center}

1. Consolidation of Documentation
2. Review of Data and Metadata
3. Data Publication

::: {.notes}
1. Review and Consolidation
  - Conduct a thorough review of the documentation and metadata.
  - Consolidate the data structure for long-term preservation and accessibility.

2. Continuous Process
  - Emphasize that this phase is a continuation and consolidation of a process that began in Phase 1.
  - Documentation and methodological recording should be carried out concurrently with data selection, collection, processing, and analysis.
  - This should be done transparently and in a standardized manner, adhering to clearly defined and publicized criteria.

3. Reference to Phase 1
  - Recommending revisiting Phase 1 for key aspects of documentation and methodological recording.

4. Data Publication
  - Emphasize the importance of making research data accessible for further research and analysis.
  - Highlight the benefits of open data practices and the potential for collaboration and knowledge exchange.
